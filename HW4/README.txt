You are to write the code for the functions specified in functions.h. Put the functions in a file functions.cpp.

In addition, write a main.cpp that has at least one call to each of
the functions in functions.cpp for testing purposes (more tests are better,
but minimum of one call to each function with appropriate parameters is 
required).  

A good way to test the functions is to write a
tester function in main.cpp for each function in functions.cpp. For testing
functions that return something, the tester functions can use assert
statements for checking the correctness of return values or modified
parameters.

For functions that do not return anything, testing functions can simply invoke
the tested function with different data inputs.

We have given you some sample code in main.cpp and functions.cpp to get 
you started.
