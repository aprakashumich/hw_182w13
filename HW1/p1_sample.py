# Lines that start with the pound character 
# are ignored by Python. We use them for comments in the program to
# make the program more readable. 


# Here is a sample Python program that asks the user for a name and prints 
# it out as "Your name is: <name>".

myname = raw_input("Please enter your name: ");
print "Your name is: " + myname;
